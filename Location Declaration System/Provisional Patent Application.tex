\section{General Project Overview}

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this project is to have students be able to declare their current location. Students do this by having RFID tags that they scan whenever they want to declare their location. Students scan their tags on boxes that are placed around campus where students would need to declare their locations. The RFID box sends these RFID tag scans to a MySQL database for later parsing.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Use Cases}

Some use cases of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Automating Classroom Attendance
	\item Automating SISO
	\item Automating Speed Bump
	\item Automating Community Meeting Sign In
	\item Automating Activity Attendance (Dance Recitals, Food Servings, Blue and Gold Week Presentations)
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Importance of Project}

Many required activities at LSMSA are either inefficient or not Covid friendly.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Classroom attendance takes too long. LSMSA, having 262 classes meeting 2.5 times a week for 32 weeks a year means that attendance is taken 20,960 times a year.
	\begin{center} 262 classes * 2.5 meetings/week * 32 weeks = 20,960 attendances taken \end{center}
Assuming that taking attendance takes one minute per class period, teachers spend 350 hours or 14.5 days per school year taking attendance. Attendance on a year-long scale takes far too much time and needs to be automated so teachers can do what they do best, teach.
	\begin{center} 20,960 attendances/year * 1 minute = 20,960 minutes / 349.33 hours / 14.56 days \end{center}
	\item The current solution for student locations (SISO using Reach) is a clunky, expensive mess. Students rarely update it with their actual locations, there is no method to ensure students are being honest, and Reach does not consistently work among many other issues.
	\item Currently, speed bumping students requires the students to stand at the front desks of the dorms and make sure that the front desk worker sees them. If the front desk worker misses them, the student has to go down at 7 pm to speed bump again. This means multiple students are all walking to the desk at the same time, which is not good for social distancing.
	\item For community meetings, students wait outside the doors and slowly walk in getting their IDs scanned. This is not a good system since it is not only slow, but makes students group together allowing for Covid to travel between them.
	\item For food events or events happening in the Recital Hall, students have to sign a sheet of paper stating that they are there. To do this, students all use the same pen and paper, which is not good for preventing germs from spreading.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%
\section{Hardware Overview}

This project has three main pieces of hardware, all communicating with each other to successfully scan student's RFID IDs.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{RFID Box}

RFID Boxes are physically placed at locations where students need to declare their locations. Inside the boxes are two boards communicating with each other: the NodeMCU ESP-12E and the RC522.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{NodeMCU ESP-12E}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{esp-12e.jpg}
\end{center}
The NodeMCU ESP-12E is the brain of the RFID box. Essentially, a NodeMCU ESP-12E is an Arduino with a WiFi chip built-in. This allows it to run Arduino code to interact with the RC522 but also be able to communicate with the MySQL database through the school's WiFi.
\newline\newline
The NodeMCU ESP-12E also has a blue LED (like a small light bulb) built-in. This LED provides the user with confirmation whenever they scan their RFID ID.
%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{RFID Reader RC522}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{RC522.jpg}
\end{center}
The RC522 is the board that reads the RFID tags. Whenever a RFID tag is scanned, the contents of the tag are sent to the NodeMCU ESP-12E.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{RFID Tag}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{RFID Tag.png}
\end{center}
A RFID tag contains an ID that is transmitted to the RC522 when in close proximity. Each student is issued one RFID tag.

%%%%%%%%%
\section{Software Overview}

This project has two main pieces of software: The program on the NodeMCU ESP-12E and the MySQL Database. These two pieces of software communicate with each other over the school's WiFi.

\subsection{MySQL Database}

A good way to think of the MySQL database is like an Excel spreadsheet. Here is a picture of the current iteration of the MySQL table:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=7cm]{MySQL Table.png}
\end{center}
The columns in this table represent a type of data, whereas every row represents a different log.

The timedate is the time of the scan, rfid\_id is the RFID ID of the scan, and the location is the location of the scan. The timedate data is in military time to avoid needing am/pm.

\subsection{Setting Up Arduino Software}\label{programming box}

Open up the Nodemcu\_Program.ino file.

The screen should look like this:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{Arduino Program.PNG}
\end{center}

Make sure that the board selected is NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{Arduino Program 2.PNG}
\end{center}

Make sure that the correct port is selected. This may take a couple tries to get the correct port.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{Arduino Program 3.PNG}
\end{center}

Next, click the upload button in the top left corner. Before uploading the program, make sure that the WiFi, location, and MySQL are all set up.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{Arduino Program 4.PNG}
\end{center}

If everything went successfully, the console should print ``Wrote 287584 bytes (209254 compressed) at 0x00000000 in 18.7 seconds (effective 123.2 kbit/s)... \\
Hash of data verified.'' and look like:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{Arduino Program 5.PNG}
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Configuring WiFi}

Insert the WiFi username and password into the two fields below:

Keep the quotation marks around the username and password.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Arduino]
char ssid[] = "WiFi Username";
char pass[] = "WiFi Password";
\end{lstlisting}


%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Configuring Location}

Insert the RFID box's location into the field below:

Keep the quotation marks around the location.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Arduino]
char location[] = "location"; 
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Configuring MySQL Database Connection}

Insert the MySQL IP Address, username, and password into the three fields below:

Keep the quotation marks around the username and password.
In the MySQL IP address exchange the periods for commas. Ex: 192,54,563,654 when the IP is 192.54.563.654.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Arduino]
IPAddress server_addr(IP Address); 
char user[] = "MySQL Username";    
char password[] = "MySQL Password'';   
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Testing Box}

Once the program is uploaded, open the serial monitor. The following should appear:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{Serial.PNG}
\end{center}

If there is an error, repeat the process and ensure the WiFi, location, and MySQL are all correctly configured.

%%%%%%%%%
\section{RFID Tag Setup}

Open the rfid\_read\_personal\_data.ino example file for the MRFC522 library. Load the program onto a box and scan a RFID tag. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{Serial 2.PNG}
\end{center}

The data after ``Card UID: `` is the RFID tag ID. In this example the ID is ``FA 69 AE B2''.

%%%%%%%%%
\section{MySQL Database Setup}

In MySQL Workbench run these commands:
\begin{itemize}
	\item CREATE DATABASE Classrooms\_Prod;
	\item USE Classrooms\_Prod;
\end{itemize}
This creates a database on the MySQL server and selects it for further commands.

%%%%%%%%%
\section{Adding a Location}

Run these commands:
\begin{itemize}
	\item USE Classrooms\_Prod;
	\item CREATE TABLE ``location name'' (
	\item timedate VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
	\item rfid\_id TEXT NOT NULL,
	\item location TEXT NOT NULL
	\item )
\end{itemize}

Change ``location name'' with the name of the location. Do not include the ``''. This should be the same location name that is in the Arduino program.


%%%%%%%%%
\section{Remove a Location}

Run these commands:
\begin{itemize}
	\item DROP TABLE ``location''
\end{itemize}

Change ``location name'' with the name of the location. Do not include the ``''. This should be the same location name that is in the Arduino program.

%%%%%%%%%
\section{Future of Project}

This project is far from being finished. The items in this section would make the project more complete and a better system. In the future, the items in this section would be added to the system.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Redundancy}

Having redundancy in a system like this is paramount. In a normal attendance system, the redundancy is to write student names down on a piece of paper. While this can be a final layer of redundancy for this system as well, it would be better to have a faster solution. Also, considering that this system has many pieces, there needs to be redundancy for each piece.
\newline\newline
We need redundancy for these scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A student loses their RFID tag
	\item A RFID box breaks
	\item The MySQL database doesn't respond
	\item Attendance gets entered incorrectly
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{RFID Tag Backup}

Students can easily lose their RFID tag if it falls off their lanyard or breaks. Students should have a person they can go to who can assign them a new RFID tag and update their tag ID in the system. The good news is that this is not a long or complicated process, just not implemented yet.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{RFID Box Backup}

\Large
	\begin{tikzpicture}[x=11mm, y=20mm,yscale=1]
		\node (a) at (0,0)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Connect to Wifi / Connect to MySQL / Connect to Time Server};
		\node (b) at (0,-1)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Blinks 3 Times (Confirms Connections)};
		\node (b2) at (0,-2)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Wait for Teller RFID Tag};
		\node (c) at (0,-3)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Wait for RFID Tag};
		\foreach \i/\j in {a/b, b/b2, b2/c}
			\draw [-Latex] (\i) -- (\j);
		
	\end{tikzpicture}
\normalsize

The addition to the project here is that during the setup phase (before the RFID box waits for a RFID Tag) the RFID box waits for a teller tag. This teller tag will have a location ID on it. The RFID box uses this location ID to set its current location. These backup RFID boxes would be in common areas near classrooms for easy access. The RFID teller tags would be left on a desk or on a wall hook in each location. Having backup RFID boxes ensures that if a box is to break, then there is a quick and easy backup minimizing downtime for the system.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{MySQL Database Backup}

\Large
	\begin{tikzpicture}[x=11mm, y=20mm, xscale = 3]
		\node (a) at (0,0)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{RFID Box Sends Log to MySQL};
		\node (b) at (-1,-1)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{MySQL Receives Log};
		\node (c) at (1,-1)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{MySQL Error};
		\node (d) at (1,-2)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{RFID Box Sends Log to Backup MySQL};
		\foreach \i/\j in {a/b, a/c, c/d}
			\draw [-Latex] (\i) -- (\j);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\normalsize

The addition to the project here is that there is two possibilities after the RFID box tries to send a location log to the MySQL database. In the current iteration of this project, if a log fails to send, nothing happens. In this new iteration, if this happens, then the RFID box would send the log to a different MySQL database. Having this ability allows for the box to have a much lower chance of failing to send a location log.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Attendance Correction}

\Large	
	\begin{tikzpicture}[x=11mm, y=20mm,yscale=1, xscale = 3]
		\node (a) at (0,0)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Set Time Hits After Classes};
		\node (b) at (0,-1)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Sends Daily Attendance to Every Student with Google Form};
		\node (c) at (-1,-2)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{No Form Filled};
		\node (d) at (1,-2)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Error Correction Form Filled};
		\node (e) at (1,-3)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Notifies Teacher};
		\node (f) at (-0.5,-4)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Teacher Approves Correction \\ or Teacher Ignores Request};
		\node (g) at (-0.5,-5)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Attendance Updated};
		\node (h) at (2,-4)[draw, rectangle, align=center]{Teacher Rejects Correction};
		
		\foreach \i/\j in {a/b, b/c, b/d, d/e, e/f, f/g, e/h}
			\draw [-Latex] (\i) -- (\j);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\normalsize

The addition to the project here is that students have the ability to correct a wrong attendance log. For example, if two RFID boxes get mixed up somehow or a student's RFID tag fails to read, then the attendance will still be correct. If a student's attendance is wrong, they can fill out a google form. This form's data is parsed through and another email is sent to teachers asking them if the attendance correction is correct. There are two possibilities at this point. If the teacher approves the correction or ignores the email, then the attendance correction is assumed to be correct and the attendance logs are updated. On the other hand, if the teacher rejects the correction, then the attendance correction is assumed to be incorrect, and the attendance logs are not updated.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{RFID Box Wall Holder}

One problem with the current implementation of this project is that students might have troubles getting their RFID tags close enough to the RFID boxes to get a read. A solution to this problem would be having a wall holder for each RFID box.
\newline\newline
There are two possible implementations of this solution:
\newline\newline
Implementation 1 would be to have a command strip hook that would be stuck to the wall. The RFID boxes would have a hole in the back of them to hang on the command hooks. This is a good option for temporary setup since the command hooks can be taken down easily.
\newline\newline
Implementation 2 would be to have a sleeve that is screwed into the wall. The RFID box would be inserted into this sleeve. This is the better option for long term implementation. One of the downsides of this is that since the RFID sleeves are screwed into the wall, it is hard to change the position of them.
\newline\newline
The best solution would likely be a mix of both implementations with implementation two being used more for classrooms and building entrances where the positions are constant and implementation one being used for events where the locations are not always the same. 

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Injection Molded Case}

Although having a 3D printed case is good for rapid prototyping, having the case be injection molded would have many benefits.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cheaper (in bulk)
	\item Faster to produce
	\item Less work needed (current box needs to have 3D printing support removed)
	\item Stronger
	\item Does not wear down as fast
	\item Stays clean longer (space between 3D printing lines can collect dust)
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{BlackBaud Integration}

BlackBaud is the backend for many school systems. This project could interface with BlackBaud using BlackBaud's API. The location logs could be downloaded and parsed by python, which would send the data to BlackBaud.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Downloading Data at Night}

At night, all of the data from the MySQL database could be downloaded. This will allow for there to be a backup of the data and allow for the data to be parsed. 

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Clips Inside for RFID Reader RC522}

Currently, the RC522 board is aligned using pins in the model. However, it would be much nicer and last longer if clips were added to the model to secure the board down.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Automating Textbook Check-Out}

If textbooks were each given a RFID sticker, students could quickly grab textbooks, scan them, then scan their ID and the system could automatically check out the textbook to the student. This would allow for the textbook checkout and return process to go much faster.

%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
To conclude, this project has massive potential for speeding up everyday school processes and ensuring that students do not crowd together or share common items. \\ I personally feel that if this gets implemented at a school, the following effects could be achieved:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Teachers would have more time to teach since they no longer need to take attendance.
	\item Student would get sick less due to not being as crowded and sharing less items.
	\item Processes like speed bumping and signing into events would go faster/smoother. 
\end{itemize}
For the low cost of \$546.61 the first year and \$50.81 each subsequent year, implementing this system is very cost effective considering teachers spend 350 hours a year on attendance alone and many hours speed bumping and other processes where students declare their location. \\

Assuming this system is used for attendance since the time taken is easy to calculate the cost would be: \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item First Year: \$1.56 per hour saved
	\item Subsequent Years: \$0.145 per hour saved
\end{itemize}
